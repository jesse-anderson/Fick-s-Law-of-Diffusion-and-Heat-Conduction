# Fick's Law of Diffusion and Heat Transfer Project in Python/MATLAB
### Myself and my colleague, Ramiro Roman, in our MCS 472 class decided to model Fick's Law of Diffusivity over time and at steady state in MATLAB, Python, and Julia. We then compared the implementations and the diffusion and heat transfer calculation methods.
### We found that they were highly similar and that modeling
