# Fick's Law of Diffusion and Heat Transfer Project in Python/MATLAB
#### Myself and my colleague, Ramiro Roman, in our MCS 472 class decided to model Fick's Law of Diffusivity over time and at steady state in MATLAB, Python, and Julia. We then compared the implementations and the diffusion and heat transfer calculation methods.
#### We found that they were highly similar and that modeling heat transfer was more straightforward. Note that the primary difference between the two is the diffusion coefficient. This coefficient, k, will be spatially-dependent in diffusion and will generally be a uniform constant in heat transfer. It is however possible for the heat equation to be spatially dependent in cases wherein there are two different materials adjacent to each other.
